the plan for the snake is that an array is created and the head sets a square to a value before moving
every moving timestamp, each square goes down in value by 1
when it gets to zero, the square is deemed no longer part of the snake
this allows drawing curves into the snake, based of its neighbors having one higher if its in front, and one less if it has less

board array notes
0 means it's nothing/blank
> 0 means it's a part of the snake
-1 means its the apple/goal
<-1 shouldn't happen
